Box Challenge

I struggled with this assignment and used several resources (listed below) to complete the Box Challenge.
I found your Module 5 practice files and ReadMe notes extremely helpful. It was great when it was similar for parts of this assignment because sometimes I am unsure what I am doing wrong when I get errors so it is nice to refer to your similar examples. I used console.logs and debugger a lot too for trial and error but I definitely could use more practice with debugger and JS overall. Thank you for everything!
